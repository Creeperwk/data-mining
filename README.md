# Data mining project

## Dataset
- The dataset collected is related to 17 campaigns that occurred between May 2008 and November 2010,
corresponding to a total of 41,118 clients.
- For the project, 10,000 records are randomly allocated to each group; you can find the allocated dataset on
Moodle.

## Method
- Perform exploratory analysis on the training data set.
- Apply five classification techniques (knearest neighbours, linear/quadratic discriminant analysis, tree-based methods, support vector machines, neural networks, adaptive boosting)
- Create appropriate graphs or summaries that communicate the results from these methods.
- Comment on the graphs/summaries and interpret the results.
- Compare the results to choose a final, “best” classification model, with justification given for the choice and comment on this model’s overall performance using appropriate evaluation measures.

## Conclusion
-
