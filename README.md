# Data mining project: Bank marketing

## Dataset
- The dataset collected is related to 17 campaigns that occurred between May 2008 and November 2010,
corresponding to a total of 41,118 clients.
- For the project, 10,000 records are randomly allocated to each group; you can find the allocated dataset on
Moodle.

## Task
Based on the dataset, predict if the client will subscribe (yes/no) a term deposit (variable y).

## Method
- Perform exploratory analysis on the training data set.
- Apply six classification techniques (k.nearest neighbours, linear/quadratic discriminant analysis, tree-based methods, support vector machines, neural networks, adaptive boosting)
- Create appropriate graphs or summaries that communicate the results from these methods.
- Comment on the graphs/summaries and interpret the results.
- Compare the results to choose a final, “best” classification model, with justification given for the choice and comment on this model’s overall performance using appropriate evaluation measures.

## Conclusion
- Basing on the list, it seems that adapting boosting has the greatest performance, cause it has high levels in four comparisons. 
- All methods holds on a high grades around 0.8, but the recall, even the greatest one only gets merely around 0.4 grade. It can be explained that though these methods have satisfied abilities to predict the right answer, they lack of the abilities to predict right answer for the real true situation.
